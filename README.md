# Terminal Functions Library

A fast expression simplifier and evaluator for unary mathematical functions using custom rewrite rules and commutation logic. The system supports symbolic simplification and direct evaluation modes, making it suitable for terminal-based mathematical engines, calculators, or symbolic algebra systems.

## üîÑ Rules File Format (`rules.txt`)

Each line specifies a rewrite rule or logic transformation. The system supports:

### ‚ú® Basic Rewrite


---

## üîÑ Rules File Format (`rules.txt`)
Each line is a rewrite rule of one of the following forms:

- **Basic rewrite:**
```

arcsin(sin(x)) = x
abs(abs(x)) = abs(x)

```
- **Commutation:**
```

f(g(x)) = g(f(x))

```
- **Implication:**
```

h(f(x)) = x\*x

```
- **Identity:**
```

g(x) = x

## ‚öôÔ∏è Build Instructions
Clone and build using:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:RoshanYSingh23/Terminal_Functions_Library.git
cd Terminal_Functions_Library
```

Then, build everything using make:
```bash
make all
```

Run with:
```bash
make run
```

This will execute the main binary on test expressions and save the results in:
```lua
output.txt
```
